üéôÔ∏è Voice Assistant (Speech Recognition + Text-to-Speech)

This is a simple Python-based voice assistant program that listens to user speech, converts it to text, and responds using text-to-speech. It demonstrates the integration of SpeechRecognition and pyttsx3 libraries.

* Features

1) Listens to speech input through a microphone

2) Converts speech to text using Google Speech Recognition API

3) Responds with text-to-speech using pyttsx3

4) Runs in a loop, continuously listening for commands

* Requirements

Before running the program, make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.7+

Required Python libraries:

pip install SpeechRecognition pyttsx3 pyaudio


‚ö†* Note for Windows users:
If pyaudio fails to install, download the correct .whl file from PyAudio builds
 and install it manually:

pip install PyAudio-0.2.11-cp39-cp39-win_amd64.whl

‚ñ∂* How to Run

Clone or download this repository.

Save the program as voice_assistant.py.
